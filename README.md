# Image-captioning
_It's an Udacity Project_

## Description
In this project, use a CNN encoder and a RNN decoder to generate captions for input images. 
The Project has been reviewed by Udacity and graded Meets Specifications.

## Files

``` notebook 0 ``` : Can be used to explore MS COCO dataset using COCO API.

``` notebook 1 ``` : Loads and processes data from pre procesed dataset and can design CNN encoder and RNN decoder to generate automatically images.

``` notebook 2 ``` : Should be trained of the CNN-RNN encoder.

``` notebook 3 ``` : Using _notebook 2_ will generate captions of the image in test data

``` vocabulary.py ``` : Has the built from captions by the dataset.

``` data_loader.py ``` : Custom data loader for _PyTorch_.

``` training_log.py ```: Stores the training values for further use.
